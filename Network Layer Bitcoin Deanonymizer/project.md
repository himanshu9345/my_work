Developed a network layer deanonymizer for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is built on top of an anonymous P2P network where transactions are delivered through a broadcast protocol. We implemented a Bitcoin
deanonymizer which leverages Bitcoin network's broadcast protocol, it can keep on listening all broadcasted messages to find the IP address bound to each Bitcoin transaction. We also presented a detailed analysis of bitcoin network which ISP's are bitcoin hubs, Number of bitcoin nodes from each country, we were also able to map each transaction hash with the real world entity i.e IP Address. 
We used Google Cloud Instance, Python for data extraction, Mysql Database for storing the data and Bitcoin Core for setting bitcoin node.
